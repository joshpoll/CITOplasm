If you've never had Isan Thai, this is the place to go. I've gone so many times, I always bring family and friends here when they visit and we've never been disappointed. My favorite dishes are the KHAO SOI -- this is closest to yellow curry dishes people that are at most American Thai restaurants, but it has egg noodle, chicken, pickled greens and crispy noodles, sooo good. It's not a very spicy dish, but for me it builds and by the end it's clearing my sinuses. For appetizers, the GAI YAANG (BARBEQUE CHICKEN) is great - nicely seasoned with a little sweetness, SAI UA (HOMEMADE THAI SAUSAGE) is my second favorite dish - has a little heat to it too. MUU PHA LO (STEW) is my second favorite entree and I almost always get it. It's so tender and not spicy, if anything a little savory sweetness, and is great to pour the juices over rice. Lastly, I always have dessert ROTI that is has cinnamon sugar with sweet condensed milk over it. It's crispy and sweet, plus I like to add a scoop of coconut milk.\n\nFor people used to chain restaurants that pop out 100 types of dishes, that are about large sizes and not really quality....\n\nThe dishes aren't overly huge, but appropriately portioned. It's definitely quality food, that focuses on fresh dishes made traditionally. They don't adjust spiciness, to preserve the way the dish is intended to taste.

My only comment (and kind of warning) is there is absolutely no reason in the world why the scallop dish as an entree was so darn tiny. Don't get me wrong it tasted amazing but imagine taking a scallop and slicing it into 5 slivers and that is about the size of the dish. List it as an appetizer for better reference.

Specifically the braised bison meat taco this time. Also had their sweet frybread with cinnamon topping. And a cold brew coffee, but this didn't seem to have any particular feature from Native cuisine.\n\nDefinitely liked the bison taco. The frybread on which it's delivered reminds me of a kind of puffy pita. It's kind of a different twist on the handheld bread/tortilla+toppings/fillings formula that's universal around the world (tacos, pita, gyro, etc; I wonder if there is a concise culinary term encompassing this idea?). Bison meat is closest to beef out of the common meats eaten in the US, but it's definitely its own flavor. I liked it; it was well made. The toppings were kind of generic, some greens, radish, etc.\n\nThe sweet frybread appears to be the same bread base as the taco, but with sugar and cinnamon added on. There are many many topping choices other than cinnamon, but it was recommended to me. Definitely good, reminds me of sweetbreads you get elsewhere.\n\nThe cold brew was your typical cold brew.\n\nThe service was good, the host was good at recommending items to me, as this was the first time I've ever been in a Native taco place.\n\nThe space is amazing during good weather. They open the huge huge class wall to the outdoors, so you get a light filled space but also shade if you want it. And you're in the modern museum building. Really good architecture going on here.\n\nOverall, I rate it 4 stars. It's good, worth the visit, a good choice if you want something fast and not expensive, a good space, and bonus points for serving a cuisine (Native American) that's not widely available.\n\nCan't give it 5 stars because the food, while good, is not amazing.

For two people, we shared the scallion pancake, smoked tofu, crispy cauliflower, and the burger, and everything was delicious, though lacking in familiar Korean flavors. Maybe it was the dishes we got, but the most Korean thing was the side dish of kimchi we ordered. Regardless, all was very tasty! The mushrooms on the smoked tofu were a stand-out, and the curry sauce mayo for the cauliflower was phenomenal. The burger was simple but easily one of the best I've ever had!

Every one of them a disappointment, either bland or over spiced without the balancing flavors Korean food has.

When we got there, the counter was packed. We didn't know how to order so we asked a customer. We were directed to the front of the store where we could order and pay. My friend and I each ordered the fried bangus (milkfish) and salmon sinigang (soup) plate which comes with steamed rice and pancit. We also ordered 3 pieces of Shanghai lumpia. We were then directed to the back to find a seat. Since hubby ordered a poke bowl from the vendor across the walkway, we sat at their counter since it was empty.\n\nOur Filipino great arrived quickly. Our meals were served on melamine plates and bowls. The lumpia was skinny and long and served with sweet and sour dipping sauce. The fried bangus was crispy and truly delicious. The rice and pancit cut the richness of the fish. The salmon sinigang was simply divine. I loved the  sour tamarind flavor and the fresh leafy veggies. The soup was made with salmon collar so that gave the fish a rich, melt-in-your-mouth texture. No wonder this dish is what they're known for.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I wish I could have tried their adobo and other Filipino dishes. The food is cooked in true, traditional style. This place is a total gem in Pike Place Market.

The broth is flavorful, with many distinct nuances (beefy, light, not too oily, deep lingering taste, robust, etc). The noodles were evenly cooked and the beef slices and meatballs were tender, not bland but absorbed the broth's flavor. Adding in the extras such as the basil, bean sprouts, a spritz of lime, and condiments gives the soup another layer of subtle complexity.\n\nOverall, the generous portions, delicious Pho recipe, easy-going atmosphere, and friendly service makes dining at Pho Bac a nice treat.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Would I go back?\n\nYes!

Making your customers feel inferior is not a great feeling for anyone. When you asked us what we\u2019d like to drink and I said a cab. Server responded with a smirk and loudly responded \u201ca cab! Do you know our menu?\u201d. Sorry, I do not as my friend booked the place. Then when another friend asked for a coke. Again, waiter laughed so that the people around us would noticed, and responded \u201cno we don\u2019t serve coke!\u201d  Again, she\u2019s a busy girl and did not research the menu beforehand. We\u2019re easy people, we\u2019ll try any place. Then when my friend asked if she could get a new plate, server responded \u201cwhy what\u2019s wrong with yours\u201d? She said ummm too many bread crumbs and stuff on my plate. He said \u201csure even though you can use that bowl over there, but here I\u2019ll get you a plate\u201d. Too many issues with service. Being snobby is not a trend, this is Seattle\u2026we\u2019re casual people here. So I\u2019m thinking maybe they act this way cause food is top notch? First three plates were light and yummy. The last few plates were overly salted. Flavors were not well balanced. It wasn\u2019t terrible by any means, but due to behavior of the employees maybe I have higher expectations, u know, to match the food \ud83d\ude06 If your into just having good food and a relax night out with friends.

Also, I have no idea which part of the food served is inspired by Japanese food as the name (and story) of the restaurant implies. (Don\u2019t get me wrong. I wasn't expecting we\u2019d get served sushi). I had a couple of different servers but no one asked us how\u2019s the food or if we needed anything. I don't think I should pay a good tip for just mediocre service, pretending that the restaurant is upscale.", "time": 1658560143, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "TG", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101341947304305081343/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SWNkYufCCabrJ4SCi6VLNkljAUH629Aniz2LJssVE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "They have limited availability but it was worth  it!

Since then, diners have flocked to this Kent strip mall to drink micheladas and eat comforting pre-colonial dishes like banana leaf-wrapped corn tamales filled with loroco and chipil\u00edn (indigenous Central American plants) while upbeat salsa music plays. The Spanish-influenced, slow-grilled churrasco chapin strip, marinated with tomato and garlic, is one of the best steaks around, and the tostada topped with chow mein (a popular Guatemalan street food) neatly contrasts crispy tostada and soft noodle. You\u2019ll also find Guatemalan breakfast foods, a comforting atol de elote in the colder months, and fried plantains stuffed with a sweet bean mixture."}}
