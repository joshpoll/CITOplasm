Since then, diners have flocked to this Kent strip mall to drink micheladas and eat comforting pre-colonial dishes like banana leaf-wrapped corn tamales filled with loroco and chipil\u00edn (indigenous Central American plants) while upbeat salsa music plays. The Spanish-influenced, slow-grilled churrasco chapin strip, marinated with tomato and garlic, is one of the best steaks around, and the tostada topped with chow mein (a popular Guatemalan street food) neatly contrasts crispy tostada and soft noodle. You\u2019ll also find Guatemalan breakfast foods, a comforting atol de elote in the colder months, and fried plantains stuffed with a sweet bean mixture."}]
