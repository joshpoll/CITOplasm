If you've never had Isan Thai, this is the place to go. I've gone so many times, I always bring family and friends here when they visit and we've never been disappointed. My favorite dishes are the KHAO SOI -- this is closest to yellow curry dishes people that are at most American Thai restaurants, but it has egg noodle, chicken, pickled greens and crispy noodles, sooo good. It's not a very spicy dish, but for me it builds and by the end it's clearing my sinuses. For appetizers, the GAI YAANG (BARBEQUE CHICKEN) is great - nicely seasoned with a little sweetness, SAI UA (HOMEMADE THAI SAUSAGE) is my second favorite dish - has a little heat to it too. MUU PHA LO (STEW) is my second favorite entree and I almost always get it. It's so tender and not spicy, if anything a little savory sweetness, and is great to pour the juices over rice. Lastly, I always have dessert ROTI that is has cinnamon sugar with sweet condensed milk over it. It's crispy and sweet, plus I like to add a scoop of coconut milk.\n\nFor people used to chain restaurants that pop out 100 types of dishes, that are about large sizes and not really quality....\n\nThe dishes aren't overly huge, but appropriately portioned.

And a cold brew coffee, but this didn't seem to have any particular feature from Native cuisine.\n\nDefinitely liked the bison taco. The frybread on which it's delivered reminds me of a kind of puffy pita. It's kind of a different twist on the handheld bread/tortilla+toppings/fillings formula that's universal around the world (tacos, pita, gyro, etc; I wonder if there is a concise culinary term encompassing this idea?). Bison meat is closest to beef out of the common meats eaten in the US, but it's definitely its own flavor. I liked it; it was well made. The toppings were kind of generic, some greens, radish, etc.\n\nThe sweet frybread appears to be the same bread base as the taco, but with sugar and cinnamon added on. There are many many topping choices other than cinnamon, but it was recommended to me. Definitely good, reminds me of sweetbreads you get elsewhere.\n\nThe cold brew was your typical cold brew.\n\nThe service was good, the host was good at recommending items to me, as this was the first time I've ever been in a Native taco place.\n\nThe space is amazing during good weather. They open the huge huge class wall to the outdoors, so you get a light filled space but also shade if you want it. And you're in the modern museum building. Really good architecture going on here.\n\nOverall, I rate it 4 stars. It's good, worth the visit, a good choice if you want something fast and not expensive, a good space, and bonus points for serving a cuisine (Native American) that's not widely available.\n\nCan't give it 5 stars because the food, while good, is not amazing.

You can get a breakfast sandwich on Japanese melonpan to add a layer of sweetness above the egg, or a smashed cheeseburger topped with \u201choisin island dressing,\u201d or an okonomiyaki-style Spanish tortilla.

Overall, this is one of the best Szechuan restaurants we\u2019ve ever been to. My only suggestion to them is to add Hot Tea (Jasmine or Oolong) to the menu. We\u2019ll be back soon!\n\nUpdate: We went there today for the second time and was happy to see that they've actually taken the above request for hot tea seriously as we were given hot tea as soon as we seated.

When we got there, the counter was packed. We didn't know how to order so we asked a customer. We were directed to the front of the store where we could order and pay. My friend and I each ordered the fried bangus (milkfish) and salmon sinigang (soup) plate which comes with steamed rice and pancit. We also ordered 3 pieces of Shanghai lumpia. We were then directed to the back to find a seat. Since hubby ordered a poke bowl from the vendor across the walkway, we sat at their counter since it was empty.\n\nOur Filipino great arrived quickly. Our meals were served on melamine plates and bowls. The lumpia was skinny and long and served with sweet and sour dipping sauce. The fried bangus was crispy and truly delicious. The rice and pancit cut the richness of the fish. The salmon sinigang was simply divine. I loved the  sour tamarind flavor and the fresh leafy veggies. The soup was made with salmon collar so that gave the fish a rich, melt-in-your-mouth texture. No wonder this dish is what they're known for.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I wish I could have tried their adobo and other Filipino dishes. The food is cooked in true, traditional style. This place is a total gem in Pike Place Market.

Pho Bac is an established Vietnamese restaurant in the International District and it is understandable how they have fared well for so long.\n\nThe restaurant is now located in a more modern space with more of a traditional dining area. You choose your Pho and other items up front as well as making your payment. The Pho portion size is very generous and a Large can be very filling. The broth is flavorful, with many distinct nuances (beefy, light, not too oily, deep lingering taste, robust, etc). The noodles were evenly cooked and the beef slices and meatballs were tender, not bland but absorbed the broth's flavor. Adding in the extras such as the basil, bean sprouts, a spritz of lime, and condiments gives the soup another layer of subtle complexity.\n\nOverall, the generous portions, delicious Pho recipe, easy-going atmosphere, and friendly service makes dining at Pho Bac a nice treat.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Would I go back?\n\nYes!

She said ummm too many bread crumbs and stuff on my plate. He said \u201csure even though you can use that bowl over there, but here I\u2019ll get you a plate\u201d. Too many issues with service.

They went above and beyond to ensure we could take our time and enjoy a lovely evening at our own pace. They were observant, incredibly kind and you can tell how healthy of an atmosphere they allow for their team to thrive.\n\n2. The food - wow. So beautiful, so creative and the flavors all complimented each other without overpowering anything else. There was one item that was a little out of the box for my pallet and they kindly brought out a vegetarian option for me to enjoy.\n\n3. The restaurant- the vibe was so minimalistic, calming and inviting. They pay attention to every detail from the silverware to the wall color.\n\nCould not recommend TOMO enough!

We both agreed d good food but it seemed overpriced since we spent $300 for two people and we\u2019re not sure what made it so expensive. They have a set menu but charge you extra for bread.

The funny thing is that a table next to us who came long after us were served the same courses at the same time as us, as if the chef were waiting to cook everything all at once. Do you think the design of food is creative? Well, if you think so, you\u2019d better explore more food.

Also, I have no idea which part of the food served is inspired by Japanese food as the name (and story) of the restaurant implies. (Don\u2019t get me wrong.

Since then, diners have flocked to this Kent strip mall to drink micheladas and eat comforting pre-colonial dishes like banana leaf-wrapped corn tamales filled with loroco and chipil\u00edn (indigenous Central American plants) while upbeat salsa music plays. The Spanish-influenced, slow-grilled churrasco chapin strip, marinated with tomato and garlic, is one of the best steaks around, and the tostada topped with chow mein (a popular Guatemalan street food) neatly contrasts crispy tostada and soft noodle. You\u2019ll also find Guatemalan breakfast foods, a comforting atol de elote in the colder months, and fried plantains stuffed with a sweet bean mixture."}}
